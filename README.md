In this project I built a Python/pygame application that automatically generates and solves crossword puzzles using two core CSP techniques: AC-3 for arc-consistency and Forward Checking for dynamic domain pruning. I organized word lists by length into “domains,” implemented a grid interface where cells can be toggled black or assigned letters, and wired up buttons to run each algorithm and reset the board. By comparing how AC-3 reduces variable domains ahead of time versus how Forward Checking prunes on the fly, I was able to analyze their behavior and performance on grids of varying size and dictionaries of different complexity. The code is cleanly modularized into main.py (GUI and event loop), tablero.py (grid model), and dominio.py (word‐domain loader).
